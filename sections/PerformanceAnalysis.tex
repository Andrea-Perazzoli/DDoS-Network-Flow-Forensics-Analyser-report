\section{Performance Analysis}
In our tool we have developer a \textit{script} which records timestamps and duration time of big data analysis in a \texttt{.csv} file, called \texttt{PerformanceHistory.csv}. The \textit{script} mentioned before is used in order to figure out the time of analysis. 
The environment in which we tested our tool is a cluster of the University of Verona, running Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS, it has an Intel Xeon Processor (Skylake, IBRS) and a memory of 7880 MiB.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|c|}

\textbf{Dataset} & \textbf{Description}                              & \textbf{Size} \\ \hline
no\_atk          & Traffic log in normal conditions, no attacks. & 1.3 GB        \\ 
dos\_atk         & Traffic log during a DoS attack.                   & 1.6 GB        \\ 
ddos\_atk        & Traffic log during a DDoS attack with 40 bots. & 1.6 GB        \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

Using our script called \texttt{PerformanceAnalysis.py} we managed to plot the time elapsed to generate and analyze the datasets listed into Tab. \ref{tab:dataset_info}: results are reported into Fig. \ref{fig:datasets_statistics}. \\
We can immediately see that the generation time is much greater for attack datasets: this is justifiable because of the greater size, considering multi-user disk accesses.
Talking about analysis statistics, we can see a spike in \textit{ddos\_atk} and \textit{no\_atk} datasets. Here, long cluster timeouts during Pig Latin script execution play a great role, and we cannot have much control over it. Without that problem, analysis of the datasets would have taken much less time.
