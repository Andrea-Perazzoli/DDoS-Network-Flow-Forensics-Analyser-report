\section{Performance Analysis}
In our tool we have developer a \textit{script} which records timestamps and duration time of big data analysis in a \texttt{.csv} file, called \texttt{PerformaceHistory}. The \textit{script} mentioned before is used in order to figure out the time of analysis. 
The environment in which we tested our tool is a cluster of the University of Verona, running Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS, it has an  Intel Xeon Processor (Skylake, IBRS) and a memory of 7880 MiB.
