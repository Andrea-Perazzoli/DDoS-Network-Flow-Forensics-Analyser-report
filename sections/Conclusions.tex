\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:colc}
We were inspired by \cite{detection_by_path_analaysis} and \cite{ddos_forensics} for the creation of our tool, we tried to find and follow a different approach for the analysis of DoS and DDoS attacks, proposed in the cited papers, and we decide to implement and use as mathematical model the standard deviation formula. Thanks to this approach we were able to bind big data power and python in order to manipulate and show analysis results.  

Focusing on the results over our generated datasets we conclude that the precision of our tool is high in \textit{UDP flood} attacks detection, but in order to evaluate the reliability of our tool test over different kind of datasets is required though real attack \textit{log} files are difficult to retrive. High precision is also achieved by not take into consideration IP address spoofing, which is a technique that give the possibility to an attacker to create Internet Protocol (IP) packets with a false source IP address, for the purpose of impersonating another computing system. In this work, we only consider the non-address spoofing flooding attack as assumed in \cite{ddos_forensics}. 

Possible improvements may be done by try to implement new mathematical model which uses data prediction like \cite{detection_by_path_analaysis} and implement \textit{Pig-latin} script, similar to our, in order to detect other attacks like \textit{SYN ack flood} attack which is very common like \textit{UDP flood}.
